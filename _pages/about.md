My name is Jair Pereira, a Ph.D. student at the University of Tsukuba. I am interested in **Metaheuristic Algorithms**, **Optimization**, and **Artificial Life**.

During my masters, I studied the automatic design of metaheuristic algorithms. In this project, I used Grammatical Evolution to recombine operators of some popular algorithms. Then, I analyzed ways to improve the training step.

Now, in my Ph.D., I am researching Similarity Metrics for Metaheuristic Algorithms.
